# Machine Learning-based prediction of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Uganda 
This repository contains the required python scripts and associated data to train and test Machine Learning (ML) models using most classifiers supported by the python's ski-learn, and associated Bioinformatics packages in a Linux environment. The sample ML script for only one set of drug(rifampicin) has been provided as jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) to enhance users ability to break the scripts down into manageable and understandable sections.
