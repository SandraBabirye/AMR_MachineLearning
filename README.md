## Machine Learning-based prediction of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Uganda 
Antimircobial resistance (AMR) is a growing challenge recognised as global health emergency posing a great threat to modern medicine.

In the current study, we ten machine learning algorithms including  **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GBC), Adaptive Boosting (adaboost), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), CatBoost** for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (STM) based on WGS and clinical data (Age, sex, HIV status)  with one hot encoding.

This repository contains the required python scripts and associated data to train and test Machine Learning (ML) models using most classifiers supported by the python's ski-learn, and associated Bioinformatics packages in a Linux environment. The sample ML script for only one set of drug(rifampicin) has been provided as jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) to enhance users ability to break the scripts down into manageable and understandable sections.
